    First week of Classes reflection
This first week of classes was pretty chill. Seeing as most of the stuff that has been taught in class, was my first time learning about those. The tools that were shared to us are pretty nice in their own way. I haven’t used some of them, but for the most part, I now have a basic idea on how to use this software. I like how the class can be fun in some ways, calming in others, but we still manage to work hard. 
Our professor has introduced us to quite a lot of learning tools and websites for our personal learning outside of the classroom. I appreciate her work, because I feel that I can learn a lot more in this class. Her classes are pretty awesome, one thing that I have to get used to is that there are a lot of activities to do. I know that I’m behind by a few activities, I’m actually struggling a bit because of my broken equipment at home. Its not easy to work on a lot of activities right now.
One of the main applications that we use in class is trello. I personally like the concept of trello, and would like to continue using this application with my future projects. I have learned so much in the first week of classes, which I thank my professor for sharing these with us.
