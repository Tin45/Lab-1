  <h3>Elevator Design</h3>
  <p style="color: lightblue; font-size: 25px"> How would you design a 1000 floor elevator?
First of all, we must consider that in todayâ€™s times, the current limit of the elevator shaft is more or less than 160 stories. With this in mind I would like to implement a system of multiple elevators following a window pattern in order to maintain a strong and sturdy support for the elevator shaft. This elevator system that I would like to implement involves using elevators that go up to about a 100 floors only. That way the safety of the people can be ensured. Now that the first part is covered, the interface that I would to implement is a keypad system in order to achieve convenient experience for the users. The keypad looks like sort of a calculator. For the elevator itself, I would like to implement the Otis elevators used by the Burj Khalifa building, due to its impressive speed, this way there would not be much waiting time between the elevators.
I would include in this work, a prototype elevator shaft design that has been made in Microsoft paint.
