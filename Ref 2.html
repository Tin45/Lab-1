First web-app using Heroku and Github

Where do I even begin with this one? The difficulties of try to push your stuff without the corresponding files and other requirements was bad enough, at first. But then as time progresses, so did my knowledge about using the two websites. When I first started, I had little to no knowledge on what I should do, what I should be doing, and how I would do it. So I took a short break to sort myself out. After which I decided to look at the trello board and look for vital information there. To my luck, the tutorial board was right there waiting for me. 
So I went and saw that in order to successfully deploy my web-app. I followed the directions step-by-step, to ensure that I wonâ€™t be making any mistakes. the whole process of doing this was indeed very fun and challenging as well. When I got to finish my codes and everything was uploaded to Github, I thought I was ready to deploy my web-app in Heroku. Guess what? I was completely and utterly destroyed by the heroko app deployer. I was literally stressing over this for about an hour and a half. So I decided to take a quick, de-stressing break aka: videogames whooo! Then back to work, so I decided to retrace my tracks, sure enough I found the answer to my problems. A small php file was all that I needed, so I was once again filled with rage and after that rage laughter as I recall my silly mistake. 
I then returned to the Heroku app deployer, but this time I was prepared, for the small php file turned into a great sword, allowing me to slay the beast, granting me access to my web-app. So overall, I enjoyed doing that web-app, the process was full of enragement and entertainment.
